# SlidePuzzle
A simple program that lets you supply an image for use in a slide puzzle.

Java 8 or higher is required to run this program.

You can use any image you want for the slide puzzle.
Simply replace the image in "res/puzzle/puzzle.png" with any image you like, or choose an image from the selector in the program window itself.
If you supply your own image by playing it in the res/puzzle/ directory, you must name it "puzzle.png".
Dimensions must either be a square, or taller than it is wide.
